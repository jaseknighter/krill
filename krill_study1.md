### background

this study attempts to demonstrate an example of a solution to a common problem that frequently arises when coding norns scripts. 

i have tried to make this study accessible to someone without any prior coding experience. it does assume a working familiarity with norns devices, e.g., how to access and change params, use maiden load a script, etc. 

after going through this study, i highly recommend exploring the splendid [first light tutorial](https://monome.org/docs/norns/study-0/) on the monome website.

i hope this study helps people get started with the known and unknown pleasures of scripting on the norns platform. 

### technical requirements
to fully take advantage of the study's contents, you will want to first install the krill script following the installation instructions in the [README file](README.md) and have it running while you are exploring  the contents below. 

### krill study 1: converting parameter ranges for the mod matrix
#### **high-level problem and solution**
the mod matrix that is built into the krill script allows parameters to modulate one another. 

the main technical challenge with this feature was to translate the current value of an input parameter to something within the min and max range of an output parameter. 

at a high level, five pieces of data had to be gathered to achieve this translation between inputs and outputs:

1. the input param's current value
2. the input param's minimum value
3. the input param's maximum value
4. the output param's minimum value
5. the output param's maximum value

to take a concrete example for this study, we'll use @justmat's lfos that were incorporated into the krill script. we will use them to change the norns reverb's return levels. 

#### sidebar 1: what is a mod matrix?
a mod matrix acts like a traditional telephone operator switchboard. it routes signals from a source (input) to a destination (output). 

#### sidebar 2: param names and ids
norns params typically have a *name* and an *id* attached to them. the param's name is what is displayed in the ui. the param's id is used to query the param, e.g. in order to get its current value or change it. 

#### **gathering the data: part i**
the 5 data points listed above can be obtained by querying the krill script's params. 

using the example of the script's lfos and reverb return levels, here are the ids of the two params we are interested in:

* `1lfo_value`
* `rev_return_level`

assuming that you have the krill script up and running, you can get the current value of these two parameters by typing the `params:get` command in the `>>` bar at the bottom of [maiden](https://monome.org/docs/norns/maiden). This is the matron REPL, where weâ€™ll enter commands and press ENTER to execute them. 

so, get get these params' current values, open maiden, click on the `>>` bar at the bottom and enter these two lines of code (one at a time):

```
params:get("1lfo_value")
params:get("rev_return_level")
```

the numbers that are printed after entering these two commands represent the params' current values.

now enter these two commands a few more times. you should get a different value each time for `1lfo_value` and the same value each time for `rev_return_level`. (why is this? discuss amongst  yourself.)

by using the `params:get("1lfo_value")` command we have one of the 5 data points we need: the input param's current value. let's set it to a variable:

```
input_val = params:get("1lfo_value")
```

now that we've created a variable for the lfo's value param, we can enter it in the REPL and get the same result as if we typed in the param directly:

```
input_val
```

#### sidebar 3: what is a variable? 
variables act as placeholders or pointers to something else. in this case, the variable we are calling `input_val` is pointing to a number. in other cases, variables can point to other things like strings of characters, boolean (true/false) values, or even other variables.

it is interesting to note that if you enter the variable `input_val` into the REPL multiple times you'll always get the same value back in return. on the other hand, if you enter `params:get("1lfo_value")` into the REPL multiple times, you'll get a new value each time. this is because the `input_val` variable is set to the value of the param at the time you created the variable by entering `input_val = params:get("1lfo_value")` in the REPL. this could be an issue in some cases, but for our purposes here it doesn't really matter.

#### **gathering the data: part ii**
to get the params' `min` and `max` values we can lookup the param itself (not just its value). we can do this using the `lookup_param` command and set a variable to the data that is returned when calling `lookup_param`, like this:

```
lfo = params:lookup_param("1lfo_value")
rev_return_level = params:lookup_param("rev_return_level")
```

with the two variables we just created, we can get a peek into the guts of the param data using the `tab.print` comand, like so:

```
tab.print(lfo)
tab.print(rev_return_level)
```

the data returned by calling `tab.print` tells us something about the params (e.g. their `name` and `id`). however, it doesn't obviously provide us with the remaining four data points listed above that we are looking for (i.e. the params' min and max values). this is because these two params are both types of params called *control* params. control params are created with *controlspecs*. 

we can tell these are control params from two pieces of information we received when we ran the `tab.print` commands above:

1. the existance of a table called `controlspec`
2. the value of `t` for each param is the number *3*

in regards to the variable `t`, this stands for *type*. it took me a while to figure this out, but searching through the norns codebase, i found a [directory of files](https://github.com/monome/norns/tree/main/lua/core/params) that told me there are are 10 types of params and after exploring these files i figured out that each type is given a unique value for `t`. here are a just a few of the other param types and their `t` values:

* separator: 0
* number: 1
* option: 2
* group: 7

(note: you can see all the param types and their `t` values in the `ParamSet` table set in the [paramset.lua](https://github.com/monome/norns/blob/main/lua/core/paramset.lua) file on GitHub.)

#### sidebar 4: what is a table?
in the notes above, you may have noticed a couple of references to *tables*. tables are the main way that data is structured in Lua (the language used to write most norns scripts). you can think of them as lists. i was going to provide a few more details about tables and how to use them, but then i remembered this is covered in the first light study mentioned above.

<!-- 
here is an example of a simple table you can create in the REPL that we'll assign to a variable called `simple_table`:

```
simple_table = {1,3,true,"mushroom"}
```

you can tell the size of a table by putting a *#* sign in front of the variable:

```
#simple_table
```

if you just type this variable into the REPL by itself you'll get a kind of confusing response that doesn't really tell you anything about the contents of the variable:

```
simple_table
```

to see the contents of a table, you can use the `tab.print` command:

```
tab.print(simple_table)
```

(you may recall we did this just a bit earlier to see the contents of the two params we set to the variables `lfo`
and `rev_return_level`.)

there are at least a couple of ways to get and set individual data elements that have been added to a table. the simplest is to use something called *bracket syntax* where you address the location (or *index*) of the data you want to change within the table.

going back to the simple table we created with the command `simple_table = {1,3,true,"mushroom"}`, we can change the last item item in the table from "mushroom" to "fruit":

simple_table[4] = "fruit"
 -->

#### back to the issue at hand
as a reminder, we are looking for the `min` and `max` values
of the lfo and reverb return level params. we didn't find them when we used the `tab.print` command two variables we created referencing the params (`lfo` and `rev_return_level`). however, they may be found in the params' controlspecs 

let's create two new variables for the params' controlspecs and then print out their contents:

```
lfo_cs = lfo.controlspec
rev_return_level_cs = rev_return_level.controlspec
tab.print(lfo_cs)
tab.print(rev_return_level_cs)
```
now, when we look at the `tab.print` outputs of these new variables, we see what we are looking for: both have the variables `minval` and `maxval`. as a result, we can now  put these min/max vals into their own variables and start working on the mapping:

```
input_min = lfo_cs.minval
input_max = lfo_cs.maxval
output_min = rev_return_level_cs.minval
output_max = rev_return_level_cs.maxval
```

we are almost there!!! well kinda almost...

#### **mapping values**
our next step is to map the value of the lfo param to the reverb return level param. happily, there are a number of functions available in the norns [util module](http://fatesblue.local/doc/modules/lib.util.html) for this.

#### sidebar 5: what is a function?
whereas variables are like names in Lua (i.e. the represent and point to other things), functions act more like verbs. a function defines an action that can produce a result. for example, all norns scripts have a function called `init` that is called when the script first loads. it is used for setup and initialization of the script. 

#### back to the issue at hand once more
the function we will use here to map the value of the lfo param to the reverb return level param is the [`linlin`](http://fatesblue.local/doc/modules/lib.util.html#linlin) function. it takes an input's value and the input's lower/upper ranges and maps this value to an output based on the outputs lower/upper ranges. 

before we apply this function to the lfo and reverb return level params, let's start with a simpler example of an input param that has a value of 5 with min/max levels of 0 and 10 and an output param with min/max levels of 0 and 100

  * input value: 5
  * input min: 0
  * input max: 10
  * output min: 0
  * output max: 100

with these five data points at hand, we can map inputs to outputs with the `linlin` function like this:

```
util.linlin(0,10,100,5)
```

running this `linlin` function in the matron REPL, you should receive a result of `50`. in this example, the input value of 5 is exactly half way between the input params min/max values of 0 and 10 and so when the `linlin` function runs it maps this input value of 5 to 50 since 50 is exactly half-way between 0 and 100. if you like, play around with these values to see what results you get (for example, change the input value from 5 to 7.5).

now let's run the same `linlin` function with the variables we've collected above for the lfo and reverb return level params:

```
util.linlin(input_min, input_max, output_min, output_max, input_val)
```

#### **Ruh-roh**
here's where we hit a snag...rather than returning a mapped value as a number, we get a return value of `nan`, which means 'not a number'. 

the first step to figuring out how where this `nan` return value is coming from is to look at the value of all the variables we provided to the `linlin` function:

```
print(input_min, input_max, output_min, output_max, input_val)
```

printing out our variables, we see numerical values returned for everything but the third variable, `output_min`, which has a value of `-inf`. 

apparently, the `linlin` function doesn't know what to do with negative infinite values. go figure...

#### **digging deeper into controlspecs**
when i was building the mod matrix it took me a while to figure how how to account for mapping parameters that, like the reverb return level, have odd min or max values like `-inf`. 

i finally found the solution by reviewing the documentation for the [controlspec module](http://fatesblue.local/doc/modules/controlspec.html). this module is used to create control parameters. 

#### sidebar 5: what is a module?
norns has many modules that were developed in order to make new norns scripts easier to create. you can find the documentation for these modules on your norns device itself by pointing your browser to *norns.local/doc*. (note: if you've renamed your norns device to something else you'll need to replace *norns* with whatever name you've given the device.)

#### **finally, the solution is upon us!**
when i was reviewing the docs for the controlspec module, i found a [`map` function](http://fatesblue.local/doc/modules/controlspec.html#ControlSpec:map) that according to the doc will 'transform an incoming value between 0 and 1 through this ControlSpec'.

so, in order to map the lfo param's value to the reverb return level param's min/max, we first need to get the lfo value into a range between 0 and 1. we can do this using the same `linlin` function we just reviewed. 

here's the code i came up with to set the lfo's value in the proper range:

```
mapper_value = util.linlin(input_min,input_max,0,1,input_val)
```

printing this variable in the REPL, (`print(mapper_value)`) we can see the lfo param's value is now mapped to a number between 0 and 1 and now we can use the `controlspec:map` function to set it to the correct value within the min and max range of the reverb return level param. 

here, we'll reuse the variable we created earlier for the reverb return value param's controlspec, `rev_return_level_cs`

```
output_val = rev_return_level_cs:map(mapper_value)
```
<!-- 
#### sidebar 6: may i have some syntactic sugar with my coffee?
you may have noticed that the `map` function we just used needs to be called with a semicolon `:` instead of a dot (`.`). using a semicolon in lua leverages something called 'syntactic sugar'. explaining this is beyond the scope of this study, mostly because i don't understand it very well, but it is a good subject for a future study.)

longwinded notes aside...
 -->

if we enter our `output_val` variable in the matron REPL we will get a new value that represents a mapping of the lfo param's value to the reverb return level param. with this newly mapped value, we can use it to set the value of the reverb return level. 

but first, so you can hear it, make sure you have the krill script running and the reverb turned on in the params menu.

...then, run this command:

```
param:set("rev_return_level",output_val)
```

...and you should hear a change in the reverb.

that's it! phew! now, i need to do the dishes. :P


### final thoughts after having done the dishes 
what i've tried to demonstrate here is not just the solution to a few coding problems, but a bit about the process of solving the problem itself. for me, the joy of coding is as much about figuring out solutions to problems as it is about arriving at the solutions themselves. 

often when i am trying to solve a problem, the solution comes after i've decided i've done all i can and have more or less given up all hope if ever figuring out a solution. 

frequently, after this has happened, i decide to take a walk dejectedly. but then, after not much time at all has passed, the solution just shows itself to me in a flash. and once in a while after i've returned home and attempted to write the idea into code, the code i've written actually works! 

coding, needless to say, can be extremely frustrating and often requires quite a bit of patience and perseverence. however, i think the pleasure of solving problems and sharing the results with the monome community is totally worth it. plus, there is are a ton of folks in the community who are eager and able to help you along this journey!
