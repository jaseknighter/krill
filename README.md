# krill

a [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) sequencer and mod matrix running @okyeron's UGen linux port of Mutable Instruments Rings for monome norns.

*krill studies for beginner scripters*: the last section of this document contains notes and and simple code that can be run in maiden's matron REPL related to a problem (one of many) i had to solve while putting this script together. i hope it is informative and useful for folks interested in learning more about coding on the norns platform.


## requirements

* norns (required)
* crow, W/, just friends, midi (optional)
* audio input to excite the MIRings engine (optional)

## installation

the install process requires 3 steps to properly install!

1. open maiden and below the "matron" tab, enter:

    `;install https://github.com/jaseknighter/krill`

2. in the same "matron" tab install the MIRings UGen with this command:

    `version = "mi-UGens-linux-v.03"; url = "https://github.com/okyeron/mi-UGens/raW/master/linux-norns-binaries/"..version ..".tar"; os.execute("wget -T 180 -q -P /tmp/ " .. url .. " && tar -xvf /tmp/"..version..".tar -C /tmp && cp -r /tmp/"..version.."/* /home/we/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/ && rm -r /tmp/"..version.." && rm -r /tmp/"..version..".tar")`

    note: you may skip step 2 above if the MIRings UGen was previously installed with either @okyeron's [MI-UGens for Norns](https://llllllll.co/t/mi-ugens-for-norns/31781) or @21echoes [Pedalboard](https://llllllll.co/t/pedalboard-chainable-fx-for-norns/31119) scripts.

3. restart your norns.

  
## about the script
the idea for the script and its name came from @mattallison and is inspired by [Todd Barton's Krell patch](https://vimeo.com/48382205). originally, i was thinking of making something like a krell acid patch, using @infinitedigits [acid test engine](https://llllllll.co/t/acid-test/52201), but eventually i replaced the acid engine with @okyeron's MIRings UGen.

this script's use of a chaotic Lorenz system algorithm differentiates it from the classic Krell patch. in theory at least, using chaos instead of randomness produces patterns that reside in a space between the random and the predictable. 


## credits

bunches and bunchs of credit are due to Matt Allison and SPIKE the Percussionist. Matt came up with the the original concept for the script and its name. i am deeply grateful to the two of them for working with me over many hours and days testing and discussing the script. 

additional thanks and credits go out to:

* @tyleretters for creating the lattice module and porting to norns the sequins module by @whimsicalraps


## caution!!!
the mod matrix built into the krill script allows any parameter to modulate any other parameter. unexpected results may result (e.g. when modulating the compressor's gain settings), so please proceed with care and caution when using this feature.

## documentation

the krill script has two basic views:

* sequencer view
* mod matrix view


### sequencer
<img src="https://github.com/jaseknighter/krill/blob/main/images/1-2-0-start_w_grid.png" width="500" />
the sequencer view is divided into three UI sections (from left to right):

1. controls 
2. Lorenz system visualization
3. Lorenz x/y and lfos

e1/e2/e3 are used to navigate the controls section. all of the UI controls found in the sequencer view are also found in the main norns params menu J(PARAMETERS>EDIT).

**notes on the grid overlay** 
- when the script is first loaded, just the second and third UI sections are visible. when an encoder is turned, the first section becomes temporarily visible, along with a grid overlaying the Lorenz system visualization. 

to make the grid overlay and UI controls section always visible after the script has been loaded, there is a PARAMETER called `grid display` in the main norns params menu (PARAMETERS>EDIT) that can be set to `always show`. 

alternatively, to make grid overlay and UI controls section always visible every time the script is loaded, open the */lib/globals.lua* file and change the value of the `UI_DISPLAY_DEFAULT` variable to `3`.



#### *seq* (sequencer controls)

  the notes generated by the krill script are based on the underlying Lorenz system algorithm. notes are selected by visualizing the algorithm and overlaying a grid on top of the visualization. 
  
  the grid is subdivided by note/octave to determine pitch, which is sent to the internal krill SuperCollider engine and/or the other supported outputs (midi, crow, Just Friends, and W/).

  there are two sequencer modes: *krell* and *vuja de*

  by default, when the script first loads, the *vuja de* sequencer is running.

- *krell* sequencer

  the krell sequencer is modelled after Todd Barton's Krell script. the vuja de sequencer is modelled after MI Marbles eurorack module. new notes are generated in the krell mode based on the rise and fall of an envelope built into the krell script's SuperCollider engine.

  when the krell sequencer is active, seven parameters are accessible from the main UI's *seq* menu:

  1. *seq mode* (sequencing mode): switch between the two sequencing modes
  2. *env sclr* (envelope scalar): scale the rise and fall time of the SuperCollider engine's envelope proportionally
  3. *rise(ms)* (rise time): envelope rise time
  4. *fall (ms)* (fall time): envelope fall time
  5. *env level* (envelope level): envelope amplitude
  6. *env shp* (envelope shape): envelope shape (smaller values create pluckier envelopes)
  7. *num octs* (# octaves): the number of octaves available to sequence

- *vuja de* sequencer

  the vuja de sequencer is structured as a set of patterns (up to six) built using the norns [lattice](https://monome.org/docs/norns/reference/lib/lattice) and [sequins](https://monome.org/docs/norns/reference/lib/sequins) modules. 

  when the vuja de sequencer is active the seven parameters listed above are accessible from the main UI's *seq* menu. 

  in addition to the seven parameters listed above, there are three additional controls on the main UI's *seq* menu specific to the vuja de sequencer: 

  8. *loop len* (loop length): the length of each pattern (1-8 steps)
  9. *vuja_de_prob* (vuja de probability): the probability that a new note will be selected for the active step
  10. *vjd div[1-6]* (vuja de pattern divisions): sets a default division of the 1-6 enabled patterns. by default each pattern has the same set of default divisions: 1,1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16,1/32,1/64

      note: the default divisions (*vjd div[1-6]*) can be modified for each of the 6 available patterns by editing a variable found in `/lib/globals.lua` called `VJD_PAT_DEFAULT_DIVS`. custom divisions may also be set while the script is running (see *division patterns* in the **sequencer param listing** below)

  - **other sequencer params**

    additional sequencer params may be found in the main norns PARAMETERS>EDIT menu: 

    ***SCALES+NOTES* section**: param settings related to scale, quantization, and number of octaves. this section of the params menu also displays the active note of the sequencer 

    ***VUJA DE* section**:  *vjd num divs* *: sets the number of active patterns (1-6)

    ****div pat assignments* sub-menu***:  the outputs available to the script (krill SuperCollider engine, midi, crow, W/, and Just Friends) may be assigned to up to two of the vuja de division patterns. 

    *** *division pattern[1-6]* sub-menu ***
    * *vjd divX*: same as the *vjd div[1-6]* referenced above
    * *vjd div numX*: sets a custom numerator for the pattern's division
    * *vjd div denX*: sets a custom denominator for the pattern's division
    * *vjd jitterX*: sets a positive or negative jitter to the pattern division
    * *vjd oct offset*: offsets the octave of the notes played by this pattern
  
    *** *rthm patterns[1-6]* sub-menu ***
    each pattern contains three rhythms that are defined as 8-step cellular automata patterns

     * *active rthm patX*: sets which of the three rhythm patterns are active
     * *vjd rthm stepX*: change the step size of the rhythm patterns from default 1 to 8
     * *vjd rthm patX-X*: sets the 3 rhythms to one of 256 patterns
     * *vjd rthm activeX*: indicates whether the selected rhythm is active. note, this "read only" param will only indicate a selected rhythm is active if the sequence mode (*seq mode*) is set to *vuja de*.

##### *scr* (Lorenz system visualization controls)
  the *scr* (screen) sub-menu's params control how the Lorenz system is displayed, which effects sequence generation:

- *x/y input***
  the Lorenz system algorithm outputs three values: *first*, *second* and *third*. the *x input* and *y input* params are used to assign two of the three Lorenz system output values to x/y coordinates and visualize the algorithm. changing the x input and y input assignments will change the shape of the visualization.

  as mentioned above, a grid is placed on top of the Lorenz system visualization which is subdivided by note and octave to set the pitch each time the sequencer plays a note.

- ***x/y offset***
  the *x offset* and *y offset* params move the Lorenz system visualization horizontally and vertically relative to the note/octave grid. this changes the pitches generated by the krill and vija de sequencers. setting these parameters to lower values will tend to lower the pitch of the notes and setting them to higher values will tend to increase the pitch of the notes.

- ***x/y scale***
  *x scale* and *y scale* changes the width and height of the Lorenz system visualization. 

  an increase to the x scale will tend to generate pitches across more notes and a decrease will tend to generate pitches of across fewer notes.

  an increase to the y scale will tend to generate pitches across more octaves and a decrease will tend to generate pitches of across fewer octaves.

  the *scr* params described above are found in the main norns PARAMETERS>EDIT menu under the *LORENZ* menu separator in the *Lorenz view* sub-menu.

- **Lorenz x/y output**
  controls for sending Lorenz x/y values to crow and midi are found in the main norns PARAMETERS>EDIT menu under the *MODULATION* menu separator in the *Lorenz x/y outputs* sub-menu. 


##### *lrz* (Lorenz system algorithm controls)
  the *lrz* (Lorenz system algorithm) sub-menu's params set a number of the Lorenz system's parameters, effecting how it behaves and gets displayed, which subsequently effects sequence generation. 

  the *lz speed* param changes how fast the algorithm changes. the other params will effect the algorthm in other ways that i don't really understand well enough to describe, but they are worth exploring and are generally "safe" to use (unlike some of the other params mentioned below).

- **additional *lrz* (Lorenz algorithm) params**
  the *lrz* params described above are found in the main norns PARAMETERS>EDIT menu under the *LORENZ* menu separator in the *Lorenz params* sub-menu.

  there are additional params related to the Lorenz system algorithm in the *Lorenz params* and *Lorenz weights* sub-menus. these additional paramschange a variety of settings for the Lorenz system algorithm. 

  *USE CAUTION* when changing the params in these two sub-menus as unexpected results may occur that sometimes cause the Lorenz system algorithm visualization to disappear and when this happens the sequencer tends to stop playing, requiring a restart of the script. 

##### *lfo* (lfo controls)
  the *lfo* sub-menu's params control two lfos:

  * *lfo*: turns the lfo on and off
  * *shape*: sets the lfo to a sine shape, a square shape, or a Sample and Hold random value generator
  * *depth*: scales the values generated by the lfo
  * *offset*: offsets the values generatored by the lfo
  * *freq*: sets the speed of the lfo

- **additional *lfo* params**
  the *lfo* params described above are found in the main norns PARAMETERS>EDIT menu under the *MODULATION* menu separator along with parameters to set how lfo values are sent to crow and midi.

  the crow parameters in this sub-menu set slew and params to scale the lfos output values to a min and max voltage.

  the midi parameters in this sub-menu set the cc and channel values to be used with the lfo as well as turn the midi version of the lfo on and off.

  finally, the read-only *lfo value* param displays the current value of the lfo.

##### *eng* (MI Rings SuperCollider engine controls)
  the *eng* sub-menu's params control the settings for the MI Rings SuperCollider engine:

  * mode controls
    * *egg mode*: setting egg mode to 1 enables the Rings easter egg, inspired by the Roland RS-09 and disasterpeace
    * *eng mode*: sets the resonator model to one of 6 modes: 
      ** *res*: resonator
      ** *sstr*: sympathetic string
      ** *mstr*: modulated/inharmonic string
      ** *fm*: 2-op fm voice
      ** *sstrq*: sympathetic string quantized
      ** *strr*: string and reverb
    * *eng mode* (egg mode): sets the 'model' to one of 6 modes: 
      ** *for*: formant
      ** *chor*: chorus
      ** *rev*: reverb
      ** *for2*: formant 2
      ** *ens*: ensemble
      ** *rev2*: chorus 2
      * *trig type*: sets excitation signal to *internal* or *external.* if set to external, an audio signal is required from the norns audio input jack(s)
  * slew controls
    * *freq slew*: sets a slew value for the pitch of notes played by the SuperCollider engine
    * *fslw enbl* (frequency slew enable): enables/disables frequency slew
  * model controls
    * *pos* (position): specifies the position where the model's structure is excited
    * *str* (structure base): with the modal and non-linear string models, controls the inharmonicity of the spectrum (which directly impacts the perceived “material”); with the sympathetic strings model, controls the intervals between strings.
    * *str rng*: sets a range that the value of the structure base param above will modulate around 
    * *brt* (brightness base): specifies the brightness and richness of the spectrum
    * *brt rng*: sets a range that the value of the brightness base param above will modulate around
    * *dmp* (damping): controls the damping rate of the sound, from 100ms to 10s
    * *dmp rng*: sets a range that the value of the damping base param above will modulate around. 
    * *poly* (polyphony): number of simultaneous voices (1 -- 4) - this also influences the number of partials generated per voice. more voices mean less partials.

    the *eng* params described above are also found in the main norns PARAMETERS>EDIT menu in the *rings* sub-menu. 

    the above parameter descriptions are copied with gratitude from @geplanteobsoleszenz SuperCollider help documentation.

### mod matrix
<img src="https://github.com/jaseknighter/krill/blob/main/images/2-1-0.png" width="500" />
the mod matrix allows any parameter to be used to modulate any other parameter. 

use k1+e1 to switch to the mod matrix view.

mod matrix settings are saved at the end of each krill session. multiple mod matrix configurations can also be saved. see the *DATA MANAGEMENT* section below for additional details.

the mod matrix UI is divided into four sections:

a. menu name<br>
b. control parameters<br>
c. input output labels and values<br>
d. patchpoints<br>

the mod matrix has 5 menus (e1 navigates between them):

#### *row/col* (patchpoint navigator)
  e2/e3 navigates the patchpoint matrix. on all mod matrix screens, k1+e2 and k1+e3 are used to navigate the patchpoint matrix.
  
  the patchpoint circles indicate the state of each patchpoint:
    * dimly lit:  disabled
    * with a dot in the middle: the patchpoint is selected for editing
    * brightly lit: patchpoint is enabled
    * left half of circle filled: an input is defined for the patchpoint
    * right half of circle filled: an output is defined for the patchpoint
    *  circle completely filled: an input and output is defined for the patchpoint 
  
#### *in/out* (input/output selection)
  e2/e3 selects the inputs/outputs for the selected row/column of the matrix.

  k1+e2 and k+e3 display parameter folders names for fast navigation between the various sections found in the main norns params menu (PARAMETERS>EDIT).

  matrix rows (a-d) represent inputs. matrix columns (1-7) represent outputs.

  changing a patchpoint's input or output will disable all the patchpoints in the selected row/column.
  
  a value with carrots at the front and end (e.g. "<<Lorenz view>>") indicates a param sub-menu.

  a value with dashes at the front and end (e.g. "--LORENZ--") indicates a param separator.

  the input and output for the row/column of the selected patchpoint can be cleared by pressing k2 + k3.

#### *pp opt* (patchpoint options)
  the patchpoint options menu updates three controls for the selected patchpoint:

  * *enbl* (enable): enables modulation of the output by the input (assuming they have been set for the selected patchpoint)
  * *lvl* (level) the value of the patchpoint output is multiplied by the lvl value. setting lvl to 0 is the same as setting the patchpoint's enbl value to off.
  * *lvlr* (level range): adds a positive or negative random value between 0 and the lvlr value. if lvlr is set to 0, nothing will be added.

#### *crow* (crow output settings)
  there are three crow controls for the selected patchpoint:

  * *enbl* (crow enable): sends the patchpont's modulation to crow
  * *out* (crow out): selects which crow output to send voltages for the selected patchpoint
  * *slew* (crow slew): tells crow to slew the voltages it sends for the selected patchpoint
 
#### *midi* (midi output settings)
  there are three midi controls for the selected patchpoint:

  * *enbl* (midi enable): sends the patchpont's modulation to midi
  * *cc* (midi cc): sets which cc to use to send midi messages for the selected patchpoint
  * *ch* (midi channel): sets the midi channel to use to send midi messages for the selected patchpoint

  note: to send mod matrix outputs to midi, a midi out device needs to be set in the midi sub-menu of the main norns parameters menu (PARAMETERS>EDIT). 


## misc parameters
### read only params
a number of parameters have are listed beneath a "read only" separatator. these are intended to be used as inputs by the mod matrix. 

### inputs/outputs 
settings for midi, crow, jf, and w/ are avaiable in the params menu.
  

### DATA MANAGEMENT
the *krill data* sub-menu at the end of the PARAMETERS menu has all the options for saving, loading, deleting mod matrix settings. saving/loading mod matrix settings also saves/loads the script's parameters.


there is a variable in the `globals.lua` file called `AUTOSAVE_DEFAULT`. setting this variable to `2` means autosave is on by default. setting it to `1` means autosave is off by default.


## feature roadmap
* fix issues with functionality, documentation, and usability 
* vuja de set loop length and probability separately for each pattern
* publish the mod matrix as a mod that other scripts can use

## krill studies

### background

the notes below demonstrate an example of a solution to a common problem that frequently arises when coding norns scripts. 

this study assumes does not assume any prior coding experience. after going through this study, i highly recommend exploring the splendid [first light tutorial](https://monome.org/docs/norns/study-0/) on the monome website.

i hope this study is helpful and results in more people getting started with the known and unknown pleasures of scripting on the norns platform. 

### technical requirements
to fully take advantage of the study's contents, you will want to first install the krill script following the installation instructions above and have it running while you are going through the contents below. 

### krill study 1: converting ranges for the mod matrix
#### **high-level problem and solution**
the mod matrix built into the krill script allows any parameter used by the krill script to modulate any other parameter used by the script. 

the main technical challenge that needed to be solved for this feature to work related to translating the current value of the input parameter into the min and max range of the output parameter. 

at a high level, there are 5 data points required to achieve this translation between an input and output parameter:

1. the input param's current value
2. the input param's minimum value
3. the input param's maximum value
4. the output param's minimum value
5. the output param's maximum value

as an example, let's take @justmat's lfos that were incorporated into the krill script. we will see below how the values they generate can be used to modulate the norn's reverb return levels. so in the context of the mod matrix, we are using the lfos as mod matrix inputs and the norn's reverb return levels as mod matrix outputs.

#### sidebar: what is a mod matrix
a mod matrix functions like a traditional telephone operator switchboard. it routes signals from a source (input) to a destination (output). 

#### sidebar: param names and ids
norns params typically have a *name* and an *id* attached to them. the param's name is what is displayed in the ui. the param's id is used to query the param, e.g. in order to get its current value or change it. 

#### **gathering the data: part i**
the 5 data points listed above can easily be obtained by querying the krill script's params. 

using the example of the scripts lfos and reverb return levels, here are the ids of the two params we are interested in:

* `1lfo_value`
* `rev_return_level`

assuming that you have the krill script up and running, you can get the current value of these two parameters by typing the `params:get` command in the `>>` bar at the bottom of [maiden](https://monome.org/docs/norns/maiden). This is the matron REPL, where we’ll enter commands and press ENTER to execute them. 

so, get get these params' current values, open maiden, click on the `>>` bar at the bottom and enter these two lines of code (one at a time):

```
params:get("1lfo_value")
params:get("rev_return_level")
```

the numbers that are printed after entering these two commands represent the params' current values.

now enter these two commands multiple times. you should get a different value each time for `1lfo_value` and the same value each time for `rev_return_level`. (why is this? discuss amongst yourself.)

by using the `params:get("1lfo_value")` command we have one of the 5 data points we need, the input param's current value. we need just the first value for the lfo's value, so let's set it to a variable we can use later, after we determine the min and max values for each param:

```
input_val = params:get("1lfo_value")
```
#### sidebar: what is a variable? 
variables act as placeholders or pointers to something else. in this case, the variable we are calling `input_val` is pointing to a number. in other cases, variables can point to other things like strings of characters, boolean (true/false) values, or even other variables.

so, now that we've created a variable for the lfo value param, we can enter it in the REPL and get the same result as if we typed in the param directly:

```
input_val
```

#### **gathering the data: part ii**

to get the params' `min` and `max` values we can lookup the param itself (not just its value) with the `lookup_param` command and attach the table that is returned to a variable, like this:

```
lfo = params:lookup_param("1lfo_value")
rev_return_level = params:lookup_param("rev_return_level")
```

now, the variables `lfo` and `rev_return_level` point to all the data that comprises these two params. we can get a glimpse of this data with the `tab.print` comand, like this:

```
tab.print(lfo)
tab.print(rev_return_level)
```

the info we see here gives us tells a bit about the params (e.g. their `name` and `id`), but nothing about the remaining four data points listed above that we are looking for (the params min and max values). this is because these two params are both types of params called *control* params. control params are created with *controlspecs*. we can know this from two pieces of information we received from running the `tab.print` commands:

1. the existance of a table called `controlspec`
2. the value of `t` in each param's out is `3`

in regards to the `t`, this stands for type. searching through the [norns codebase](https://github.com/monome/norns/tree/main/lua/core/params), we see there are 10 types of params and each type is given a unique value for `t`. here are a just a few of the other param types and their `t` values:

* separator: 0
* number: 1
* option: 2
* group: 7

(note: you can see all the param types and their `t` values in the `ParamSet` table set in the [paramset.lua](https://github.com/monome/norns/blob/main/lua/core/paramset.lua) file on GitHub.)

back to the issue at hand, finding the params' `min` and `max` values, we can run tab.print again on the params controlspecs, but first, let's create two new variables for the controlspecs and then print out their contents:

```
lfo_cs = lfo.controlspec
rev_return_level_cs = rev_return_level.controlspec
tab.print(lfo_cs)
tab.print(rev_return_level_cs)
```
now, when we look at the `tab.print` outputs of these new variables, we see what we are looking for: both have the variables `minval` and `maxval`. so now we can put these min/max vals into their own variables and start working on the mapping:

```
input_min = lfo_cs.minval
input_max = lfo_cs.maxval
output_min = rev_return_level_cs.minval
output_max = rev_return_level_cs.maxval
```

we are almost there!!! well kinda almost...

#### **mapping values**
in order to map the value of the lfo param to the reverb's return level we need to find a method. happily, there are a number of functions available in the norns [util module](http://fatesblue.local/doc/modules/lib.util.html) for this.

the function we will use here is the [`linlin`](http://fatesblue.local/doc/modules/lib.util.html#linlin) function. it takes an input and the input's lower/upper range and maps to an output based on the outputs lower/upper ranges. 

here's a simple example:

  * input min: 0
  * input max: 10
  * output min: 0
  * output max: 100
  * input to convert: 5

with these example variables we can map inputs to outputs with the `linlin` function like this:

```
util.linlin(0,10,100,5)
```

running this function in the matron REPL should return a result of `50`.

now, let's run the same function with the variables we've collected above for the lfo and reverb return level params:

```
util.linlin(input_min, input_max, output_min, output_max, input_val)
```

#### **Ruh-roh**
here's where we hit a snag...rather than returning a mapped value as a number, we get a return value of `nan` which means 'not a number'

the first step to figuring this out is to look at the value of all the variables we provide to the function:

```
print(input_min, input_max, output_min, output_max, input_val)
```

printing out our variables, we see numerical values returned for everything but the third variable, `output_min`, which has a value of `-inf`. apparently, the `linlin` function doesn't know what to do with negative infinite values. go figure...

#### **digging deeper into controlspecs**
when i was building the mod matrix it took me a while to figure how how to account for mapping parameters that, like the reverb return level, have odd min or max values like `-inf`. i finally found the solution by reviewing the documentation for the [controlspec module](http://fatesblue.local/doc/modules/controlspec.html). this module is used to create (type 3) control parameters.

in the controlspec docs, i found a `map` function that, according to the doc, will 'transform an incoming value between 0 and 1 through this ControlSpec'.

so in order to perform this mapping to the reverb return level param, i first need to get the lfo value into a range between 0 and 1. i was able to do this using the same `linlin` function we just reviewed, and so i came up with some code like to set the lfo's value in the proper range and then map it, like so:

```
mapper_value = util.linlin(input_min,input_max,0,1,input_val)
```

printing this variable in the REPL, (`print(mapper_value)`) we can see the lfo param's value is now mapped to a number between 0 and 1 and now we can also use the `controlspec: map` function to set it to the correct value within the min and max range of the reverb return level param. 

here we'll reuse the variable we created earlier for the reverb return value param's controlspec, `rev_return_level_cs`

```
output_val = rev_return_level_cs:map(mapper_value)
```

(note: you may have noticed above that the `map` function needs to be called using a semicolon (`:`) instead of a dot (`.`). using a semicolon in lua leverages something called 'syntactic sugar'. explaining this is beyond the scope of this study, mostly because i don't understand it very well, but it is a good subject for a future study.)

longwinded notes aside, if we enter our `output_val` variable in the matron REPL we will get a new value that represents the lfo param value being successfully mapped to the reverb return level param. with this value we can now use it to set the value of the reverb return level. 

but first, so you can hear it, make sure you have the krill script running and the reverb turned on in the params menu.

then, run this command:

`param:set("rev_return_level",output_val)`

...and you should hear a change in the reverb.

that's it! phew! now, i need to do the dishes. :P


### final thoughts after having done the dishes 
what i've tried to demonstrate here is not just the solution to a few coding problems, but a bit about the process of solving the problem itself. for me, the joy of coding is as much about figuring out solutions to problems as it is about arriving at solutions. when i am trying to solve a problem, often the solution comes after i've decided i've done all i can and have more or less given up all hope. frequently, after i've given up, i decide to take a walk and then the solution just shows itself to me in my mind and sometimes the solution actually works! 

coding, especially i think for beginners, can be extremely challenging and often requires quite a bit of patience and perseverence. however, i think the effort is worth it and there is a very large community attached to monome that is here to help!
